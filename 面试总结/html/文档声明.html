    What does <!DOCTYPE ...> HTML Tag do?
    The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration is used to inform a website visitor's browser that the document being rendered is an HTML document. While not actually an HTML element itself, every HTML document should being with a DOCTYPE declaration to be compliant with HTML standards.
    <!DOCTYPE> 声明不是 HTML 标签；它是指示 web 浏览器关于页面使用哪个 HTML 版本进行编写的指令。
